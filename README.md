GolfApp
====================

I need a project to work on to cement all of this angular stuff I've been learning.
After watching some golf on tv (it was a slow sports day) I thought about my own time golfing.
Why was I always having to keep track of a scorecard and a pencil along with all of the other
stuff that goes along with the game. Back when I last picked up a club there wasn't a way to do it online,
so I thought that sounded like an interesting project.

My intent is to build a web app where a user can create an account, log in, select a golf course from a database, and keep track of their score as they play. The database would include the holes and pars for each hole, the user just has to enter their score after each hole. Maybe I'll include some badges or other alerts for eagles and double eagles.

Additionally, I'd like to put in some functionality where the user can look through all their previous games. Perhaps eventually there will be some tracking information or data that can be visualized with d3js. We shall see.
